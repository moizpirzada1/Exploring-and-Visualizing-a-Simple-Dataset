# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## 📌 Task Objective
The goal of this task is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships. This includes descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to identify data trends and outliers.

## 📂 Dataset Used
- **Name:** Iris Dataset
- **Source:** Scikit-learn's built-in dataset (`sklearn.datasets.load_iris`)
- **Features:** Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- **Target:** Species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)

## 🧠 Models Applied
- No ML models were applied in this task.
- The task focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **visualization** only.

## 📊 Key Results and Findings
- **Setosa species** is visually separable from the other species, particularly in petal measurements.
- **Scatter plot** between `sepal_length` and `petal_length` shows clear clustering based on species.
- **Histograms** reveal nearly normal distribution for most features.
- **Box plots** highlight slight outliers, especially in `petal_width`.
- The dataset is clean, balanced, and ideal for classification modeling in future tasks.

- `Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and plots
- `README.md`: Summary of the task
